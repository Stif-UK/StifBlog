<br>
During the day I'm a professional software tester, leading a team currently specialising in correspondant banking software. I love my job. I get to spend all day working with broken software until it finally works, only to move on to the next project which inevitably involves more broken software...


<br>
When I get home I love nothing more than to spend time with my wonderful son Caleb.
