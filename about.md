**IT professional, student, family man, geek.**

<br>
During the day I'm a professional software tester, leading a team currently specialising in correspondant banking software. I love my job. I get to spend all day working with broken software until it finally works, only to move on to the next project which inevitably involves more broken software...


<br>
By night I'm a diligent student, studying towards a bachelors degree in software development with the [Open University](www.open.ac.uk).

When I do find myself with some spare time to hang out with friends, I enjoy sitting down around a table to play some board games.

As I get closer to the completion of my degree I thought it would be nice to have my own little corner of the internet where I could post little coding projects I was playing with - I have a couple of simple web apps in mind that I keep saying I'll make, but had nowhere to put...until now.
